### Project 4: Communicate Data Findings

## The data is recommended by Udacity as the first option data set. 

Direction to Download the Recommended Dataset:
1) https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data 
2) https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data
3) https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html

It is within the Ford GoBike System Data which is updated in the AWS repository as within the Baywheel data folder. 

The study for this project includes the 201909-baywheels-tripdata to 202004-baywheels-tripdata monthly baywheel trip dataset. 

## Two notebooks, two HTML files and a readme file included in my submission:

1) notebooks
A data exploration notebook -> included
A slide show/presentation notebook -> included

2) HTMLs
A data exploration HTML file -> included
A slide show/presentation HTML file -> included

3) Readme
Finally, there is a readme file included in my submission -> included

## The main findings include best and wide usage of the bike for the location in various starting and ending station for the Lyft bike rental business. 

For example:

1) The plotting with count and end station id show that the bike rental outliner often occur if the end station is about 250 and 30 as they produce two peaks among all stations. There are extreme stations for rental business that has short rental duration.

2) Start station with small id usually has bike rental with small duration in second.

3) If the bike is not shared for all trip usually has higher duration in second for bike rental than those who shared bike for all trip in the data set.
  
## Furthermore, the code are also working and functional with good coding practice such as with data structure, data object, inspection, cleaning, plotting, slide and various visualization techniques. 

## The data explorations systematically create the plotting that are necessary for the reasoning and justification of the exploration. The questions and answer or observation are documented in the report with appropriate interpretation and visualization. As the result of the above, the findings also covey the summary and key insights with polished plots and labels.
